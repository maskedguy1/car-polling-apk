This code represents a Car Pooling App built using Flutter, which provides functionality for users to either post or book a ride. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

Main Class:

The CarPoolingApp class is the root of the app, setting the theme and starting the application with the LoginPage.
LoginPage:

The LoginPage includes options for users to either log in or sign up. Upon clicking the buttons, the user is navigated to either the WelcomePage or SignUpPage.
SignUpPage:

The SignUpPage is a simple form where users can create an account and navigate back to the login page.
WelcomePage:

After logging in, the WelcomePage is displayed. It contains a drawer for navigation to profile or settings, and a bottom navigation bar to toggle between two options: "Post a Ride" and "Book a Ride".
PostRidePage:

This page allows users to post a ride by entering pickup and destination locations and selecting a date and time using a DateTimeField widget.
BookRidePage:

Similar to the PostRidePage, this page lets users book a ride by inputting the necessary details and selecting a date and time.
State Management:

The navigation between "Post a Ride" and "Book a Ride" is handled through a BottomNavigationBar, updating the displayed page dynamically based on user interaction.
Features Used:

DateTimePicker: The app leverages DateTimePickerFormField from the datetime_picker_formfield package to select date and time.
Flutter Navigation: Pages are navigated using Navigator.push and Navigator.pop.
Stateful Widgets: StatefulWidget is used in WelcomePage, PostRidePage, and BookRidePage to manage user interactions and state changes.
This app provides a basic but functional foundation for users to participate in a carpooling service.
